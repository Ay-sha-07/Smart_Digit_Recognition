# Smart_Digit_Recognition
Smart_Digit_Recognition focuses on handwritten digit classification, a key challenge in computer vision and machine learning. Variations in writing style, size, and orientation increase complexity. The trained model accurately recognizes and classifies digits (0–9) from handwritten images using image processing and pattern recognition techniques.
